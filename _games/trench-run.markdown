*Trench Run* is a mayhem-filled, laugh a minute casual multiplayer action game brought to you by the makers of *King Arthur's Gold* and *Soldat*. Blow your enemies to bits in muddy trenches, then sip wine with them at the bar in the first multiplayer shooter with no death.


### One, two, three, four!
When writing the music for this game, we though of chess as a militaristic strategy game, and ended up with a strong focus on marching snares and rhythms, which we combined with a modern, mildly western-influenced guitar/bass/kit line-up.
