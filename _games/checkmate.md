*Checkmate* is a cross-over between *Civilization V* and chess. Collect ore, build and upgrade your city, train your pawns and beat the enemy! Play chess like you've never played it before, with new pieces, new rules and all in real-time... Play with friends online, or go solo against the computer to train your skills, and, due to the randomization, everything feels and plays differently every single time!

### One, two, three, four!
When writing the music for this game, we though of chess as a militaristic strategy game, and ended up with a strong focus on marching snares and rhythms, which we combined with a modern, mildly western-influenced guitar/bass/kit line-up.

##### Greenlight
Checkmate is currently on [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701612583 "Steam Greenlightâ€”Checkmate"), so head on over there and give it a little vote!
