Mortal Metanoia is an action-packed alien platform shooter made in 72 hours for The Post-Apocalyptic GMC Jam #1.

### New horizons
In keeping with the post-apocalyptic alien theme, we decided to create a synth-heavy, electronic soundscape for this game, inspired by games such as Jet Force Gemini and the Metroid Prime series, and classic sci-fi films the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey.

(As an interesting aside, all the music was written in the last 10 hours before the game was turned in, so it proved to be an interesting experience in short deadline work!)
