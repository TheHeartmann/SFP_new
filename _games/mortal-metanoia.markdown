Mortal Metanoia is an action-packed alien platform shooter made in 72 hours for The Post-Apocalyptic GMC Jam #1.

###New horizons
In keeping with the post-apocalyptic alien theme, we decided to create a very electronic soundscape for this game, inspired by games such as Jet Force Gemini and the Metroid Prime series, and classic sci-fi films the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
