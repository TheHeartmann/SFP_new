When life is over, ghosts gather at the mystical Ever-Floating Comet to find a place to rest for eternity. In there, they search for a special place designated for them inside walls and crevasses, where they can find peace and enlightenment. Ghosty Ghost has just arrived, but apparently there’s no spot properly fit for him. Not only that, but the environment has become slightly unpleasant with the appearance of otherworldly spikes that are disturbing the balance of the Comet.

### A soft world
Depicting a tranquil place of eternal rest, the world of *Aftertile* is one of calm, serenity, and softness. As such, the music is being composed with this in mind, and while it is chiptune music at its core, the addition of gentle reverbs, pianos, and harps softens it up and creates a much less jagged version of the genre.

Soundtrack duties for this game are split between us and the talented [Eduardo Zolhof](https://soundcloud.com/eduardo-zolhof "Eduardo's SoundCloud").
