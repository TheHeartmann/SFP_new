*Trench Run* is a mayhem-filled, laugh a minute casual multiplayer action game brought to you by the makers of *King Arthur's Gold* and *Soldat*. Blow your enemies to bits in muddy trenches, then sip wine with them at the bar in the first multiplayer shooter with no death.


### Silly multiplayer fun.
With *Trench Run* we wanted to go for a contrast between music and gameplay. While the game is fast and loaded with action the music is made up of jazzy acoustic guitars strumming along in a happy go lucky swing feel.
