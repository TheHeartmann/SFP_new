*Campus Master* is a school building simulator, where you build your own small basic school - stone by stone and room by room - to be able to educate your students. Get them to pass grades by providing them a good learning environment, a perfectly designed school infrastructure, well trained staff, and the equipment needed to satisfy your students needs.


### Nostalgia.
For *Campus Master* we wanted to have a bit of an nostalgic feel to the music. We purposefully used older sounding synths to create a bit of an hommage to classic soundtracks we used to listen to while playing games in our younger years. Synths, E-Pianos and string ensembles come together for a positive, but also bittersweet backdrop for building your own dream schools.
