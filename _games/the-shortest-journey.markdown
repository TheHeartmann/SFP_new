*The Shortest Journey* is a short dialog-free point and click adventure game set in Mexico, where you play as Manu, a young boy dreaming of finding big treasure.
This game was made in two weeks for the Adventure Jam 2016.

### Smooth Manu!
Manu is a chill dude, so we decided to go with some mid-tempo Ska, driven by off-beat guitars and hummable panflute melodies. As a counterpart to this we also have a more ambient track with soft drum rhythms featuring more unusual instruments, like the didgeridoo.

We also did all of the soundwork, recording sounds made by the characters as well as designing ambiences and mechanisms.
