*Caveblazers* is an action focused platformer roguelike set in a fantasy world. The game takes place in a recently discovered cave, said to hold "unimaginable power". You play as an adventurer setting out to explore the cave and find out what riches it holds, however you are not the only one.

### Loot & Legends!
The music for *Caveblazers* features a wide variety of medieval instruments paired with a big percussion section. We wanted to convey both the classic medieval feeling as well as have it sound epic and adventureous.
