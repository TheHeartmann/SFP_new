Thomas holds a first class bachelor of music from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts and is currently working on a degree in game programming. Experience from working with orchestras, musicals, dance shows, and all kinds of bands has helped shape his musical vision; so too has writing for picture and games, the latter of which he has found to be the most rewarding creative endeavor yet. A big fan of RPGs, strategy games and platformers, Thomas loves everything from quirky to dead serious, from EXP to action skills, and from jiggies to Pok√© balls.
