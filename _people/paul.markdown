Paul currently pursues his bachelor's degree, majoring in cultural studies with a focus on music and auditory culture. Coming from a pop/rock background he developed an early interest in game and film music, honing his compositional craft working on numerous projects along the way. Writing music for video games has given Paul the opportunity to experiment with many different styles and moods, enjoying the wide variety offered by the industry. When he's not working on music Paul is likely to be found playing adventure and MOBA games, preferably with a cold beverage and some snacks at hand.
