Beautiful things spring forth from the humblest of circumstances, and the most amazing adventures all start somewhere. When they first met at a high school in Tokyo, neither could have imagined just how much they would end up working together, but, as with all adventures, the unexpected makes for a much better story!

Now, about a decade later, Sounds for Pixels work together to bring life and soul into all kinds of video games. Drawn in by their shared love of video games, these guys work tirelessly to put together just the right sounds for their clients. Latin ska? Sure. Old school charm? No problem. Gypsy jazz? You've got it, boss!
