A couple of weeks ago SFP applied for spots on the InnoGames Jam—"the first major game jam at Gamescom 2016 in Cologne"—and we are happy to announce that we have received our invitations and will be attending both the fair and the game jam in August. This marks our first big outing, and we are looking forward to getting down and dirty with some fresh faces and new ideas, and to checking out as much as we can of the fair, which ([according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamescom "Gamescom")) is "the world's largest gaming event". Color me all kinds of excited!

Last time we participated in a game jam, we worked with [Matt Frith](www.mattfrith.com "Matt Frith") on [*The Shortest Journey*](http://gamejolt.com/games/the-shortest-journey/149463 "Get the game here"), a point-and-click game set in Mexico, music from which you can find in the [portfolio section]({{site.url}}/portfolio "Portfolio").

Also, sorry for the delay in getting the track spotlight up. We are working on it, and hopefully will have it live in not very long, so sit tight and follow us on twitter, and we'll let you know when it's up.

Furthermore, we are making some minor adjustments to the site, so certain elements might disappear and new ones might pop up—there is now a playlist right on the home page, for example.
