Welcome to Sounds for Pixels' (at the time of writing) brand new site! We have spent a fair amount of time working on this, and are very excited to share it with all of you. While on the blog page, Thomas is alone right now, that won't be the case for too much longer. You see, we have a lot of cool content coming up, and while I'm afraid we can't promise to have it narrated by Danny Wallace (in fact, I can almost guarantee you that we will not), it will hopefully still be able to interest and humour you for a little while.

Now, about the website, there is a fair amount of functionality that might not be apparent to everyone from the very start. Email, for example. You see that round picture of me over on the left?[^1] If you hover over it, you'll see a nice blue mail icon. Click the image, and you'll be sent to your default mail client ready to send me an email. The same goes for the about section. In fact, if you see our faces somewhere on the site, you can probably click them.

if any errors

[^1]: You won't if you're on a phone, as we had to prioritise the text. I know it's a shame, but if you really wanna look at my face, head on over to the about section!
